The 3 systems:
    1. latitude/longitude as we know them. Defining a point on earth itself. A given point spins with the earth.  
    2. right ascension/declination. Defining a point which is stuck to a sphere where earth is but which does not spin. Once a day, the gridlines of right ascension will line up with longitude, and declination with latitude.  
    3. ecliptic latitude/longitude. Used to define points on a sphere that doesn't spin, and is rotated so that the sun is always at its "equator" 

Equitorial Coordinate System
 (2 above)
    - RA zero is vernal equinox, like 0 longitiude is Greenwich meridian
        - http://www.stargazing.net/kepler/ellipse.html#twig06
    


Stars:
- dont need to mess with ecliptic
- get database of RA and DEC for stars
    - http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/bsc5.html
- Another database

Sphere Image
    - get location from GPS
    - get current time
    - get current phone orientation 


    - Stars
        - old system computes users location from 
            - an observed altitude and azimuth of an object
            - the location of a celestial object over earth in equitorial coordinates (lat/long)
            - the parallax angle

        - given lat/long of current user
        - compute alt/az of a given object (star for now)
        


- Stellar Parallax
    - varies with location of earth through year
    - https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/teachers/attachments/parallax.html#:~:text=The%20Parallax%20Angle%20%2D%2D%20How,the%20Earth%20to%20that%20star.
    - is the angle at the star on a triangle formed between the star and the location of earth at two places along its orbit, the locations are 6 months apart and equidistant from the star
    - proxima centauri has largest parallax angle of  0.7687 Â± 0.0003 arcsec
    - can ignore stellar parallax as phone sensors will have much more noise so wont be able to discern difference

- Diurnal Parallax
    - varies with location on the earth
    - Lunar

        - max around 1 degree of arc
