The 3 systems:
    1. latitude/longitude as we know them. Defining a point on earth itself. A given point spins with the earth.  
    2. right ascension/declination. Defining a point which is stuck to a sphere where earth is but which does not spin. Once a day, the gridlines of right ascension will line up with longitude, and declination with latitude.  
    3. ecliptic latitude/longitude. Used to define points on a sphere that doesn't spin, and is rotated so that the sun is always at its "equator" 

Equitorial Coordinate System
 (2 above)
    - RA zero is vernal equinox, like 0 longitiude is Greenwich meridian
        - http://www.stargazing.net/kepler/ellipse.html#twig06
    

Stars:
- dont need to mess with ecliptic
- get database of RA and DEC for stars
    - http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/bsc5.html
- Another database

Sphere Image
    - get location from GPS
    - get current time
    - get current phone orientation 

    - Stars
        - old system computes users location from 
            - an observed altitude and azimuth of an object
            - the location of a celestial object over earth in equitorial coordinates (lat/long)
            - the parallax angle

        - given lat/long of current user
        - compute alt/az of a given object (star for now)
        


- Stellar Parallax
    - varies with location of earth through year
    - https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/teachers/attachments/parallax.html#:~:text=The%20Parallax%20Angle%20%2D%2D%20How,the%20Earth%20to%20that%20star.
    - is the angle at the star on a triangle formed between the star and the location of earth at two places along its orbit, the locations are 6 months apart and equidistant from the star
    - proxima centauri has largest parallax angle of  0.7687 Â± 0.0003 arcsec
    - can ignore stellar parallax as phone sensors will have much more noise so wont be able to discern difference

- Diurnal Parallax
    - varies with location on the earth
    - Lunar
        http://www.etwright.org/astro/moonpar.html
        https://www.eso.org/public/outreach/eduoff/vt-2004/Background/Infol2/EIS-G4.html
        - max around 1 degree of arc

Photo Processing
    - layer -> transparency -> add alpha channel
    - ellipse select 
        - select planet
        - invert
        - delete
    - crop tool
        - select smallest square containing circle
    - image -> scale image -> reduce to 100px per side
    - export

Todo:
    - iphone avoid getting permissions multiple times
    - iphone wrong direction if upside down (more specfically if 45 deg north vector goes below horizontal when screen is downward
    - fix circular exp averaging
    - handle orientation change?
    - [x] on iphone resample difference between relative and absolute heading 
    - [x] fix http issues issues
    - add parallax?
    - fix jitter with 1 euro filter
    - messier? 
    - [x] weird rendering on load, mainly in iphone, maybe need to render on resize
    - [x] labels shouldn't wink out when stars go off screen
    - [x] When zoomed in distance to label increases
        - actually star map works this way to keep as is
